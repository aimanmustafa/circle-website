        <h1 style="color: crimson ;">ABOUT TECH KARO</h1>

        <p>CIRCLE firmly believes that investing in women is the smartest economic venture of today.</p>

        <p>The World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index 2020 ranks Pakistan 151 out of 153 countries. In Pakistan,
            as high as 68% female graduates do not join the workforce and women who do enter the economy are
            underrepresented in senior management positions or on boards. Furthermore Pakistan has only 26% women in its
            formal work force which is one of the lowest in the region.</p>

        <p>Women have been declining in the tech industry, worldwide. By 2043 at the current trend less than 1% of the
            global tech workforce will be female. In Pakistan, women represent only 14% of the IT workforce and 13% of
            IT managers (P@SHA, 2012).</p>

        <p> To tackle the gender parity issue in the tech field and to create a pipeline of women in tech, CIRCLE has
            been running technological training for young girls from under served communities under the Tech Karo
            initiative. CIRCLE in collaboration with EngoVoPak, Engro Foundation and WeConnectFoundation has initiated
            #TechKaro, a program that brings technology, coding, web development, digital marketing and graphic design
            combined with life skills (discipline, resilience, problem solving, financial planning) to women to enable
            them to increase their livelihood, and generate positive impact for their families and communities.</p>

        <p> #TechKaro has two different divisions in Karachi, on in Gulshan-e-Iqbal in collaboration with Usman
            Institute of Technology and on in Lyari, in partnership with Lyari Girls Café.</p>
